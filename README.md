## Purpose

This Software gives you the ability to reduce the downloadspeed of every windowsprocess by 3 clicks.

## How does it work?

It uses the QoS-Windows Policies, they are not precise thats why there is only 4 options to throttle the downloadspeed: slow, medium, fast, ultrafast. This is most likely sufficient for many applications to don't take down your juicy bandwidth.

## How do I use it?

Just start the application, choose the process you wanne limit, select the speedlimit and hit the limit checkbox. Done.
The configuration will persist even when the application is closed, since there is an QoS-policy created in Windows.
To deactivate you just select the application in your list and hit the limit checkbox again.
